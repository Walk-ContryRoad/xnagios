Nrobot was originally created in late 2015 at World Online, the Web github.
In Faurecia in ShangHai, China.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made Nrobot that much better:

    CHENG Canux <canux.cheng@faurecia.com>
    LIU Lei (LEU) <lei.leu.liu@faurecia.com>
    LI Paul <paul.li@faurecia.com>
    XU Jesse <jesse.xu@faurecia.com>
    BAILAT Patrick <patrick.bailat-ext@faurecia.com>
    CHERROUD Mohamed <mohamed.cherroud-ext@faurecia.com>
    JIANG David <david.jiang@faurecia.com>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    Thanks Faurecia (China) Holding Co., Ltd. for the platform.

    And thanks colleagues for code review and test the project and feedback bugs.

    Thanks Guido van Rossum for creating Python.
